        "input": "What is OCD?",
        "output": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed to reduce anxiety. The cycle typically includes obsessions causing distress, leading to compulsions for temporary relief."
    },
    {
        "input": "What is Exposure and Response Prevention therapy?",
        "output": "ERP is the gold standard OCD treatment involving gradual exposure to feared situations/thoughts while resisting compulsive behaviors. This breaks the association between obsessions and compulsions, teaching that anxiety decreases naturally without rituals."
    },
    {
        "input": "Are intrusive thoughts in OCD dangerous?",
        "output": "No, intrusive thoughts are mental noise and don't reflect a person's character or desires. The content often contradicts one's values, which is why they cause such distress. Treatment focuses on changing the relationship with these thoughts rather than eliminating them."
    },
    {
        "input": "What medications help OCD?",
        "output": "SSRIs at higher doses than for depression are first-line treatments. Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, may be used when SSRIs are ineffective. Medications are most effective when combined with ERP therapy."
    },
    {
        "input": "How long does OCD treatment take?",
        "output": "Significant improvement often occurs within 12-20 sessions of ERP, though severe cases may require longer treatment. Maintenance of gains requires continued practice of skills learned in therapy."
